# Society for Internetwide Wallet Financial Telecommunications (SIWFT)

# What is SIWFT?

SIWFT is an API endpoint that enables the creation and processing of online transactions without any connection to real-world currencies like euros, dollars, etc. Using this API, you can create wallet hubs, wallets, and process and verify transactions. SIWFT serves as the central endpoint for handling digital transactions that do not involve physical goods, content, or real money.

# Do we work with SWIFT?

**__No, we do not.__** We are not affiliated with SWIFT and do not utilize their endpoints or services.

# Why SIWFT and how did it come about?

The concept of SIWFT emerged in connection with the popular online chat platform Discord Inc. The idea was to develop a centralized system that resembles the real-world financial system, providing younger generations with a practical understanding of how it operates.
